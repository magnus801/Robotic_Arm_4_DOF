# Robotic_Arm_4_DOF
This robot was desgined as a part of learning of course "Robotics and ROS2 - Learn by doing Manipulators".Used Gazebo and rviz to simulate robot and applied inverse kinematics to move robot,
The robot was desgined in Solidworks and Was Laser cutted for Manufacturing,The robot was controlled using Servo motors and Arduino and motors command was established through ROS2
